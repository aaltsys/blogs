    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I am reposting a comment from Google’s Docs blog. The literary flow of this composition is absolutely priceless, the way it starts out about Google’s features … but then it is about corporate IT … and finally, it wraps up with the therapeutic value of blogging. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;@Everyone:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any experiences using Gladinet with Google Docs? Good, bad, so-so? Has it even been out long enough for people to find any little bugs? I don’t want to install it on my home PC, since I wouldn’t know how to fix any possible resulting problems. But just recently I’ve started to not caring about what it might do to my work PC, if our system allows me to download it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;!&#8211; more &#8211;&gt;
At my work they’ve decreased our limits on data storage and e-mail account capacity to save $ on server space. (Nevermind the fact that this data and e-mail is primarily for work). I hear that a lot of companies are doing this latetly. A friend of mine at smaller company says her workplace is even looking into cloud-storage “corporate” options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not even one of those server-hogs like people who downoad 1TB of music files, but these new limits they’re putting in place are already getting quite tedious. And they’ve also instituted this cracked-up e-mail archiving system that compresses e-mails more than 14 days old! After that, you can only see the archived message as a web page, which you have to log in to every time you want to look at a message. You can forward it as a decompressed message to someone else, or even to yourself at your personal e-mail account. But it’ll never show up in your work e-mail account as a decompressed message, ever again! Supposedly this will save loads of money…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they turn around and announce that they’re re-landscaping around the whole facility, and they’re super-excited about making it all look pretty (even though it’s more than fine as is) and aren’t we all excited, and keep an eye out for all the exciting pretty stuff… etc., blah, blah&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This announcement went out yesterday, after which I promptly downloaded DropBox, as described above. I think I’ll download Gladinet tomorrow. Maybe I’ll stop there… maybe  . Hey, if they fire me, perhaps I should start a landscaping business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wow, that felt really good to rant about that. Even more therapeutic once I actually click “Publish”, though I feel a little bad about taking up the space here. Can I make up for it with some well-intentioned contributions to the Ideas page?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’m done, but thanks for listening. I promise not to rant again. Just send me the bill for this therapy session…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &amp;#8211; Beth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
