<div class="entry-content"><p>I mentioned patient care efficiency issues to a doctor, and he pointed out how regulatory reform could play a huge part in fixing this problem. But then he went on to say that the hospital system had hired the best possible consultants — from the aeronautics industry, no less — to identify improvements in efficiency. I was unable to reply, since I know about aeronautics.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Back in WWII, my mother was hired as a bucker on the B17 line, which gave her the income necessary to move her brood of four out of the converted chicken coop they lived in during the depression. Boeing hired women as buckers, and paid them less than the male riveters, because women could crawl into tight spaces in the fuselage. In Marietta Georgia, Duke Wolff solved this problem for Lockheed by hiring dwarfs. Boeing engineers for the B17 designed a standard set of bucking bars to fit all riveting positions in the airframe. A worker who specialized in the tail sections re-manufactured his bars. Consequently, he outperformed the production flow, and gained a little free time. The foreman asked him to sweep the floor, since he wasn’t busy, but he locked his toolbox and went home for three days instead. The production line halted until he returned.</p>

<p>At the end of the war, my mother found a new husband with a military pension, and a disability to match. This move was smart and necessary, as the aircraft manufacturers kept the higher-cost men on the line while firing women, dwarfs, and the guy bucking in the tail assemblies. Efficiency was no longer important. Defense contractors were on cost-plus contracts, and the time pressure of a war was gone. Instead, aircraft manufacturing upscaled into aeronautics by concentrating on technology and the occasional bribery scandal. Okay, regular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_bribery_scandals">bribery scandals</a>. And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing#Unethical_conduct">more controversies</a>. So how efficient is the aeronautical industry today? Boeing’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787">787 Dreamliner</a> achieved first flight on December 15, 2009, more than two years behind schedule.</p>

<p>And my point? Technology cannot answer every problem. High-tech industry consultants are the wrong people to study personnel efficiency in a field such as health care. It is no surprise that health care is inefficient, when it looks to technology to solve personnel management problems.</p>
