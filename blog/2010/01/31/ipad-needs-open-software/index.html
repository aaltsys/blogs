<div class="entry-content"><p>There are writers who express my opinions better than I ever could my self. An example of this comes from Fraser Speirs, in the <a href="http://speirs.org/blog/2010/1/29/future-shock.html">following blog entry</a>:</p>

<p>“Many will cling to … the idea that the computer-based part of [a job] is the “real work”.</p>

<p>It’s not. The Real Work is not formatting the margins, installing the printer driver, uploading the document, finishing the PowerPoint slides, running the software update or reinstalling the OS.</p>

<p>The Real Work is teaching the child, healing the patient, selling the house, logging the road defects, fixing the car at the roadside, capturing the table’s order, designing the house and organising the party.</p>

<p>Think of the millions of hours of human effort spent on preventing and recovering from the problems caused by completely open computer systems. Think of the lengths that people have gone to in order to acquire skills that are orthogonal to their core interests and their job, just so they can get their job done.”</p>

<p>Fraser is praising the vision of the Apple iPad, but his comments strike to the heart of technology. For the past twenty-five years, I have been saying that we are in the pre-model-T days of the computer. We do not yet have a computer which allows us to use technology without understanding it, in the way that we can use an automobile without knowing how it works.</p>

<p>Apple Computer has led the market in making the computer for the rest of us, but they are not the only contributor. The Xerox machines in Redmond force the rest of the industry to innovate, to add value exceeding the base cost of an OEM Windows Home license. The Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) movement demands that the ability to innovate should be essentially free for all who wish to contribute, not just those willing to pay extortionate developer license fees. There has been a movement to control the development of software in general, not just the computer operating system. A very few companies own a great deal of the technology of the computer, and they leverage their position to wrest software development control away from the individual developer or inventor.</p>

<p>But the highly technical nature of the computer should not obscure that fact that creativity is an essential element in software. Developing the software in the computer demands the same intellectual organization skills as writing a book. Publishers pay decent authors, they add value with copy editing, type setting, and marketing, and they promote the author’s work. Publishing is a competitive industry. Contrast publishing with the concept of the software app store. An application for the iPhone must be written specifically for that platform. The development environment is proprietary, and the approval process for the store is arbitrary. The programmer must use an Apple computer as the development platform. Apple contributes next to nothing in the development, and then they demand a hefty commission for allowing the app to be published.</p>

<p>What we need in the computer industry is a model which allows software to be consumed the way books are read. We need computers that do not depend on knowing the arcana of IP addresses and DNS services. Then we need to purchase software to teach, to sell, to order, to repair. Before paying for that software, we must know that it will perform its function for us. And we need to know that the person who sold us the software can fix its ills when we discover them. Which brings me to the point. Software which is not developed in the FOSS model, and delivered with both source code and free development environments, is a bad idea. Proprietary code cannot be repaired by the journeyman technician, and it cannot be used transparently by the person who lacks technical skills.</p>
