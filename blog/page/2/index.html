  <div class="entry-content"><p>In 1997, IBM was losing the battle to get computer manufacturers to preinstall  OS/2. While Win ‘95 was clearly inferior to OS/2, manufacturers offered Microsoft’s product instead of IBM’s. The reasons for this market rejection were 3-fold. First, Microsoft contracts required manufacturers to purchase a Windows copy for every machine they made. Second, Microsoft engaged in a FUD campaign suggesting that non-Microsoft solutions were risky. Third, OS/2 was an extra expense which few customers were willing to pay.</p>

<p>In the face of Microsoft’s wildly successful product distribution methods, IBM sent out teams of evangelists to convince consumers to choose OS/2. In other words, Microsoft targeted computer manufacturers as their real customers, while IBM targeted consumers. It did not help that IBM’s CEO was the former head of Nabisco, so of course he believed in direct consumer marketing.</p>

<p>Today Microsoft has a virtual monopoly on consumer operating system installs, with their only real commercial competition coming from Apple. Along the way, Microsoft has tuned its product to benefit their customers, the hardware manufacturers, rather than consumers. For example, Microsoft has refused to add effective security features to Windows XP. Microsoft did not improve OS performance for 5 years, until the introduction of service pack 3. Microsoft has certified computers as “Designed for Microsoft XP” when generic XP copies will not install on the systems due to proprietary circuitry. All these things work to get customers to buy new computers, when their old hardware is perfectly serviceable.</p>

<p>Wait, Wait! You mean my old hardware is still serviceable? Yes, it is. In fact, typically one can pick up a computer from the curb which will work just fine with Linux (Ubuntu or Mint are my favorites), even though recent Windows releases cannot run on it. And, Linux is free. FREE! This is Microsoft’s marketing challenge. Steve Ballmer expressed this problem in 2006: “The greatest competitive threat we face is our own ability to either embrace or compete with alternative business models.”</p>

<p>Interestingly, Microsoft’s latest marketing ploy is the “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cX4t5-YpHQ">Windows 7 Launch Party</a>.” Here, Microsoft goes virtually direct to the consumer to promote Windows, bypassing its relationship with the hardware vendors. In fact, Microsoft brags about the improved performance in Windows 7 which allows it to run on older computers. So in 2009, is Microsoft adopting IBM’s strategies from 1997?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Does open source make sense as a business strategy for product development? Here is how an engineer might look at this question. Products have a life cycle in four phases: introduction, growth, maturity, and obsolescence. Traditionally, the highest cost for a product should come in the introduction phase. Then efficiency of manufacture and marketing effectiveness kick in to reduce costs and increase profitability. Businesses try to avoid investing in mature products, so that the gap between sales and cost, that is, profit, can be maximized.</p>

<p>Proprietary technological products require continued investment to keep ahead of the competition. As products become more complex, the cost of support and development increase over time, reducing profit. Increasing costs force companies to increase prices, which is why MS-DOS sold for $35, while Windows 7 costs $350. By comparison, the iPhone costs much less today than when it was introduced, since it experiences high sales growth and reduced manufacturing costs. Apple will replace this product when a more profitable alternative has been developed, long before price and sales erosion leads to obsolescence.</p>

<p>While comparing Microsoft and Apple, thinking of them as competitors would be a mistake. Apple sells desirable physical products based on open-source core technologies, while Microsoft sells proprietary core technology. Microsoft is trapped into supporting its technology even as it becomes obsolescent, while Apple is not. Microsoft’s product costs are increasing over time. As a result, Microsoft averages about $600,000 in revenue per employee, while Apple tops $1,000,000 per employee. A closer comparison to Apple Computer might be Dell, who sells a comparable product line. Granted, Dell does not convey the cachet of desirability that Apple enjoys. But Dell’s bigger problem is in product cost. Dell pays Microsoft a fee for every computer they build, while Apple’s incremental operating system cost is zero.</p>

<p>So who validates this engineer’s view? Despite the recent financial melt down, there are some sharp cookies investing in Wall Street. An increasing stock price is the most telling predictor of future profitability, in the investor’s view. Now here are the five-year stock trends for Microsoft, Dell, and Apple Computer. In 2004, Dell, Microsoft, and Apple all sat at around $30 per share. In fall 2009 Apple is approaching $200, Microsoft is down to $25, and Dell … Dell is around $15. Could the claim that open source is a losing strategy be in error?</p>

<p>AAPL, MSFT, DELL 5-year trends</p>

<p>Maybe Microsoft and its consumer PC manufacturers are out of step in rejecting open source technology. Open source software development is funded by captains of IT such as IBM, Apple, HP, Sun, Oracle, and Intel. These companies make significant revenue selling into markets where reliability and performance matter, and open source software has proved its worth in these areas. By funding open source development, sponsoring companies pool their investments and reduce costs. While serving consumer products companies with a proprietary product, Microsoft cannot share its development costs with other firms.</p>

<p>Despite the noise they are making, Microsoft actually has an open source strategy. They are a member of the Open Source Initiative, and they use components derived from open source code. For example, their DNS server product has always been a fork of the Unix BIND component. Their Windows Server 2003 Compute Cluster Edition uses open source, as does their Kumo search technology, and Hyper-V, and …. well, as does essentially every new technology they introduce. Sounds like a winning strategy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The WorldWide Web used to be a great big brochure, with millions of static pages linked together.  Next there was web 2.0, where web sites were dynamic and responded to the user.  Now, we are talking about social media.  So how does social media differ from what went before, and how does this affect us?</p>

<p>First, some comments about marketing.  Marketing has difficulty getting a grip on the Internet and the worldwide web, although the purpose of marketing, to persuade an audience, is independent of the vehicle or medium used.  Marketing consists of the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Establish goals for desired results from a marketing campaign</li>
<li>Identify target audiences for your campaign</li>
<li>Produce a message to be communicated</li>
<li>Develop content which conveys your message to the audience</li>
<li>Measure the effectiveness of the campaign.</li>
</ul>


<p>Only step 4, developing content to convey a message to an audience, relates to the media used in a marketing campaign.  So why should www, web 2.0, and social media be big issues for business marketing, when it is a small, albeit highly visible, part of the job?</p>

<p>Going back to 1954, Marshall McLuhan said that “the medium is the message.”  Social media differs from what went before by being participatory.  Twitter recipients engage with the medium to get and send messages.  Cell-phone users are even sprouting Panda-like extra digits to enhance their texting abilities.  The message is changed by the medium at the whim of the participants.  No wonder marketing is confused.</p>

<p>So, here are my top 10 ideas on using social media in marketing.</p>

<ol>
<li>More people are disconnected from social networks than are connected.  Of those who are connected, far more are passive viewers than are involved participants.  Social media only reaches participants, and those participants may not be your ultimate target market.</li>
<li>Analyze your audience’s rationale for using social media.  Understand their comfort zone.  Determine how you can offer a benefit or meet a need.</li>
<li>You have multiple audiences in social media.  Each medium (FaceBook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.) has a unique demographic.  Do not present every message or address every goal with every audience.</li>
<li>“The medium is the message.”  Tailor your content and presentation to the medium.  Use Flickr for community, LinkedIn for networking, FaceBook for identification, Twitter for affinity, YouTube for entertainment, etc.</li>
<li>Establish policies for using media.  Respect the privacy of participants.  Model appropriate behavior.  Avoid falling victim to bots and trolls.  Protect your communications from being hijacked into inappropriate channels.</li>
<li>You are not the only party to a communication:  a TV cannot be engaged, but a text message can be.  Be honest with your presentation.</li>
<li>One third-party endorsement is worth a thousand ad impressions.  Allow your audience to speak for you, and expect this to happen.  Target your message to referrers, and let them promote you.  Exploit the wisdom of the crowd, but avoid the noise.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to push your message at participants.  Avoid forcing the meme.  Engage your audience.  Provide incentives.</li>
<li>To communicate effectively, be entertaining, consistent, frequent, reliable.  Focus on your audience’s interests, not your own.</li>
<li>Use social media to engage in conversations, discover your audience’s concerns, and use this knowledge to convey your message in helpful ways.</li>
</ol>
