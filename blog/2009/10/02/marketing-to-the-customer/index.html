<div class="entry-content"><p>In 1997, IBM was losing the battle to get computer manufacturers to preinstall  OS/2. While Win ‘95 was clearly inferior to OS/2, manufacturers offered Microsoft’s product instead of IBM’s. The reasons for this market rejection were 3-fold. First, Microsoft contracts required manufacturers to purchase a Windows copy for every machine they made. Second, Microsoft engaged in a FUD campaign suggesting that non-Microsoft solutions were risky. Third, OS/2 was an extra expense which few customers were willing to pay.</p>

<p>In the face of Microsoft’s wildly successful product distribution methods, IBM sent out teams of evangelists to convince consumers to choose OS/2. In other words, Microsoft targeted computer manufacturers as their real customers, while IBM targeted consumers. It did not help that IBM’s CEO was the former head of Nabisco, so of course he believed in direct consumer marketing.</p>

<p>Today Microsoft has a virtual monopoly on consumer operating system installs, with their only real commercial competition coming from Apple. Along the way, Microsoft has tuned its product to benefit their customers, the hardware manufacturers, rather than consumers. For example, Microsoft has refused to add effective security features to Windows XP. Microsoft did not improve OS performance for 5 years, until the introduction of service pack 3. Microsoft has certified computers as “Designed for Microsoft XP” when generic XP copies will not install on the systems due to proprietary circuitry. All these things work to get customers to buy new computers, when their old hardware is perfectly serviceable.</p>

<p>Wait, Wait! You mean my old hardware is still serviceable? Yes, it is. In fact, typically one can pick up a computer from the curb which will work just fine with Linux (Ubuntu or Mint are my favorites), even though recent Windows releases cannot run on it. And, Linux is free. FREE! This is Microsoft’s marketing challenge. Steve Ballmer expressed this problem in 2006: “The greatest competitive threat we face is our own ability to either embrace or compete with alternative business models.”</p>

<p>Interestingly, Microsoft’s latest marketing ploy is the “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cX4t5-YpHQ">Windows 7 Launch Party</a>.” Here, Microsoft goes virtually direct to the consumer to promote Windows, bypassing its relationship with the hardware vendors. In fact, Microsoft brags about the improved performance in Windows 7 which allows it to run on older computers. So in 2009, is Microsoft adopting IBM’s strategies from 1997?</p>
