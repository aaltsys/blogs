1) How recognition works.

I really do leave the basement on occasion, despite what others say. Walking outside yesterday, I noticed a bird on the telephone wire and immediately thought, “mourning dove.” I recognized the bird from its characteristic silhouette, not its color or other features. The brain works by recognizing familiar characteristics: a silhouette, a movement, a color, a footstep, a sound. Camouflage works because it hides the unusual amongst the familiar. We are used to seeing leaf litter, and we are unfamiliar with the coils of the lurking python.

2) The graphical user interface.

The graphical user interface presents the user with a clutter of icons, ribbons, tool bars, and other detritus. Finding a familiar icon amongst all this is not too bad, but identifying an unfamiliar icon for a desired function within this collection of other unfamiliar objects is impossible. Most users struggle to familiarize themselves with the graphical elements which are common to all windows — the title bar, the scroll bars, resizing indicators, and so forth. The graphical stuff within the frame, that which changes from window to window, is a complete mystery to the average user.

3) How we learn software.

I demonstrated a Windows native upgrade for a character interface to some users. They responded with: “How are we supposed to learn all this new stuff?” I said, “How would you learn to use any Windows program? You look at the menu in a window, and see a consistent set of options under File, Edit, Query, and so forth. You note the accelerator keys which execute these functions outside of the menus. Use the menu options, or use the accelerator keys.” Of course, this is how one would learn the old character-based program, too. The problem here is learning. The biggest objection users have to functional, powerful applications is that they are “too difficult to learn.” For this reason, many line of business Windows programs are mere shadows of their character-based predecessors.

4) New interface paradigms.

Enter the mobile device. Apple Computer injected entirely new interface concepts into the computer world with the iPhone. Now users swipe, pinch-zoom, and use other gestures on their laptop touchpads or their cell phones. At the same time, the functionality of software has been downgraded again, while the interface has shrunk to 320 X 480 or so. Now we need an entire app to calculate the tip in a restaurant.

5) Where is software development headed?

Looking at the trends above, software is becoming smaller and more atomic. In the future, a software program will actually be a series of loosely associated applications, each dedicated to a single function., each designed to fit within the mobile device. The user interface will lose its confusing graphics, and head toward minimalism. The user will read instructions, or the device will speak the instructions. Users could thumb their responses, but more likely they will speak them. The interface will be linguistic, focusing on reading and speaking language. Users will understand the computer, for once, provided they understand the language.

This front-line of mobile applications will be fed from web servers running line of business applications, and managed by the priests of the server room. Real applications will move upstream to server farms and cloud computing, and the more generic the function, the bigger the cloud. Right now, my email, calendaring, and other productivity functions are hosted by Google. This blog is on WordPress somewhere. I moved my GnuCash accounting to a server near me. ‘Nuff said.
