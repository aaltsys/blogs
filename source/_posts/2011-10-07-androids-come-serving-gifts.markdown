The [Androids](http://code.google.com/android/#utm_campaign=en&utm_source=en-ha-na-us-bk&utm_medium=ha&utm_term=android) are coming; how will they serve us?

After thirty years of hearing my mother talk on the phone, I am not a phone phan. But when Apple Computer introduced the iPhone, I ran straight out to buy one … NOT!

I want a whole lot more from a hand-held device. I want it to deliver my mail, maintain my correspondence, synchronize my contacts, update my calendar, plan my shopping lists, track my personal and business finances …. In short, I want my hand-held assistant to do everything my server-connected desktop can, and then some. This is where the Android name makes sense. Google started with server farms, added distributed applications, and now offers robotic personal assistants. But these Androids will always be extensions of Google’s network infrastructure, not autonomous computers.

Google is extending a network into personal services, while Apple and Microsoft are connecting personal computers to form a network. Products from Microsoft and Apple are premised on improving personal productivity, while Google wants to influence hive behavior. Apple gives us [a music store](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) and [AT\&T phone service](http://www.att.com/wireless/iphone/). Microsoft gives us [Sidekick](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/oct09/10-15Sidekick.mspx) … oh, wait! That was a server-based service, wasn’t it? Well then, how about [WinCE](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/meet/wm65-upgrade.mspx)? Google brings us voice and text communication, collaboration technology, group productivity. Now my Android will keep you updated on how this serves us.
