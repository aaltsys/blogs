Twenty years ago there was barely an Internet, and ten years ago most Internet connections used dial-up modems. Today, everyone expects to have high-speed broadband connection to the Internet. Or do they? In many developed countries users have broadband connection rates of 10 Mbit/sec, while U.S. users typically experience sustained  cable connection speeds of 1.5 Mbs and DSL speeds less than 374 Kbs. In other words, Internet access is well below average in the U.S.

To see why this is true, we have to go back a few years. In the decade of the 90s, each telecommunications company developed infrastructure to gain a competitive edge. This all changed with the Telecommunications Act of 2001, which authorized many of the anticompetitive practices we see today. Telcos stopped investing to gain customers, and consolidated instead. While AT&T was emerging from bankruptcy they bought my provider, Bell South, for example. Service guarantees disappeared, while contracts and terms could be changed at the whim of the telco, without notice to the customer. (A similar thing happened in banking, resulting in the mortgage and credit card fiascos today.)

Rural America is essentially without broadband Internet access today. A friend of mine, living a couple miles out of Lynchburg, VA, has Internet access through a cellular tether, not a land line. And large parts of our cities are without broadband access too: the industrial areas. Frankly, telecommunications infrastructure in the U.S. is embarrassing, and there is little excuse for it. Here is how things should be. Dalton, GA has fiber to the wall for every building in the city, with speeds of 15 Mbs, for the same price as I pay for one tenth the service.

Which brings us to today. While the telecommunications companies have not changed their broadband service offering in 10 years, technology has marched ahead. Google is preparing to test community-wide 1 Gb/s fiber for some cities. To promote this service for Memphis, TN, my daughter made the following video.
