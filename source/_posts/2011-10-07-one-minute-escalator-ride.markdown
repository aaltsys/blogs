Running a technology company involves a little more than just having aggrandizing fantasies about our own efforts, while spewing paranoid rants on how our established competitors behave.  Occasionally I have to focus on the job at hand, getting a company running.

As part of this effort, AAltSys staffers have been attending entrepreneurship workshops run by [LaunchMemphis](http://www.launchmemphis.com/). A recent workshop was on creating an escalator pitch for our business idea, which we were required to package into a one-minute YouTube video. My 12-year-old daughter has posted numerous YouTube videos, and some were good, so it can’t be that hard, right? Here are some of the lessons learned from this exercise.

Identify an intended audience. Generally, pitch to prospects. If you can’t convince a prospect of your importance to him, you won’t convince a banker or an investor of your value.
As with underwear, brevity adds interest to a presentation when the content is fresh and well-developed.
Express your point simply, then elaborate it well.
Substitute clarifying terms for jargon. Some of my recommended changes included: configuration => setup, technology => standards, network => connect.
Work on the flow.
Memorize the script, so it can be spouted extemporaneously.
My best revelation from this workshop was, that I actually can explain why someone should buy an AAltSys Server. Typically, most of the cost for office computers goes to three things: software, setup, and support. An AAltSys Server pays for itself by minimizing these costs. Honestly, it shouldn’t take a minute to say that! But I took a minute anyway, in this YouTube video: [youtube=(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnLuSSAc2QA)].
