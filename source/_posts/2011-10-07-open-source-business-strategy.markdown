Does open source make sense as a business strategy for product development? Here is how an engineer might look at this question. Products have a life cycle in four phases: introduction, growth, maturity, and obsolescence. Traditionally, the highest cost for a product should come in the introduction phase. Then efficiency of manufacture and marketing effectiveness kick in to reduce costs and increase profitability. Businesses try to avoid investing in mature products, so that the gap between sales and cost, that is, profit, can be maximized.

Proprietary technological products require continued investment to keep ahead of the competition. As products become more complex, the cost of support and development increase over time, reducing profit. Increasing costs force companies to increase prices, which is why MS-DOS sold for $35, while Windows 7 costs $350. By comparison, the iPhone costs much less today than when it was introduced, since it experiences high sales growth and reduced manufacturing costs. Apple will replace this product when a more profitable alternative has been developed, long before price and sales erosion leads to obsolescence.

While comparing Microsoft and Apple, thinking of them as competitors would be a mistake. Apple sells desirable physical products based on open-source core technologies, while Microsoft sells proprietary core technology. Microsoft is trapped into supporting its technology even as it becomes obsolescent, while Apple is not. Microsoft’s product costs are increasing over time. As a result, Microsoft averages about $600,000 in revenue per employee, while Apple tops $1,000,000 per employee. A closer comparison to Apple Computer might be Dell, who sells a comparable product line. Granted, Dell does not convey the cachet of desirability that Apple enjoys. But Dell’s bigger problem is in product cost. Dell pays Microsoft a fee for every computer they build, while Apple’s incremental operating system cost is zero.

So who validates this engineer’s view? Despite the recent financial melt down, there are some sharp cookies investing in Wall Street. An increasing stock price is the most telling predictor of future profitability, in the investor’s view. Now here are the five-year stock trends for Microsoft, Dell, and Apple Computer. In 2004, Dell, Microsoft, and Apple all sat at around $30 per share. In fall 2009 Apple is approaching $200, Microsoft is down to $25, and Dell … Dell is around $15. Could the claim that open source is a losing strategy be in error?

Maybe Microsoft and its consumer PC manufacturers are out of step in rejecting open source technology. Open source software development is funded by captains of IT such as IBM, Apple, HP, Sun, Oracle, and Intel. These companies make significant revenue selling into markets where reliability and performance matter, and open source software has proved its worth in these areas. By funding open source development, sponsoring companies pool their investments and reduce costs. While serving consumer products companies with a proprietary product, Microsoft cannot share its development costs with other firms.

Despite the noise they are making, Microsoft actually has an open source strategy. They are a member of the Open Source Initiative, and they use components derived from open source code. For example, their DNS server product has always been a fork of the Unix BIND component. Their Windows Server 2003 Compute Cluster Edition uses open source, as does their Kumo search technology, and Hyper-V, and …. well, as does essentially every new technology they introduce. Sounds like a winning strategy.
