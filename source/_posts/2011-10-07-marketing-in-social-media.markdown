The WorldWide Web used to be a great big brochure, with millions of static pages linked together.  Next there was web 2.0, where web sites were dynamic and responded to the user.  Now, we are talking about social media.  So how does social media differ from what went before, and how does this affect us?

First, some comments about marketing.  Marketing has difficulty getting a grip on the Internet and the worldwide web, although the purpose of marketing, to persuade an audience, is independent of the vehicle or medium used.  Marketing consists of the following steps:

* Establish goals for desired results from a marketing campaign
* Identify target audiences for your campaign
* Produce a message to be communicated
* Develop content which conveys your message to the audience
* Measure the effectiveness of the campaign.

Only step 4, developing content to convey a message to an audience, relates to the media used in a marketing campaign.  So why should www, web 2.0, and social media be big issues for business marketing, when it is a small, albeit highly visible, part of the job?

Going back to 1954, Marshall McLuhan said that “the medium is the message.”  Social media differs from what went before by being participatory.  Twitter recipients engage with the medium to get and send messages.  Cell-phone users are even sprouting Panda-like extra digits to enhance their texting abilities.  The message is changed by the medium at the whim of the participants.  No wonder marketing is confused.

So, here are my top 10 ideas on using social media in marketing.

1. More people are disconnected from social networks than are connected.  Of those who are connected, far more are passive viewers than are involved participants.  Social media only reaches participants, and those participants may not be your ultimate target market.
1. Analyze your audience’s rationale for using social media.  Understand their comfort zone.  Determine how you can offer a benefit or meet a need.
1. You have multiple audiences in social media.  Each medium (FaceBook, YouTube, Twitter, etc.) has a unique demographic.  Do not present every message or address every goal with every audience.
1. “The medium is the message.”  Tailor your content and presentation to the medium.  Use Flickr for community, LinkedIn for networking, FaceBook for identification, Twitter for affinity, YouTube for entertainment, etc.
1. Establish policies for using media.  Respect the privacy of participants.  Model appropriate behavior.  Avoid falling victim to bots and trolls.  Protect your communications from being hijacked into inappropriate channels.
1. You are not the only party to a communication:  a TV cannot be engaged, but a text message can be.  Be honest with your presentation.
1. One third-party endorsement is worth a thousand ad impressions.  Allow your audience to speak for you, and expect this to happen.  Target your message to referrers, and let them promote you.  Exploit the wisdom of the crowd, but avoid the noise.
1. Do not attempt to push your message at participants.  Avoid forcing the meme.  Engage your audience.  Provide incentives.
1. To communicate effectively, be entertaining, consistent, frequent, reliable.  Focus on your audience’s interests, not your own.
1. Use social media to engage in conversations, discover your audience’s concerns, and use this knowledge to convey your message in helpful ways.
