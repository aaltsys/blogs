One of my favorite guerrilla marketing ideas is affinity search indexing.  In this concept, an item is posted to a forum such as YouTube, where the index words of the item match popular, but possibly unrelated, search terms. There are various ways to use this idea, and a new one came to my attention.  A fired marketing executive took out Google AdWords ads offering his services, and he indexed his ad search terms by the names of the six ad executives he most admired. You might as well not try this job search method today, though.

In _Management of the Absurd_, Richard Farson says: “Once you find a management technique that works, give it up.” His point is that effectiveness is directly proportional to novelty. Once a management technique is converted into a practice and institutionalized, you can bet it will accomplish nothing. Popular management techniques which depend on rules for improving performance are doomed to fail.

Back to marketing. The successful marketer must innovate constantly, providing a stream of presentations that surprise the audience intellectually. This is how comedy works also, and comedians may make good marketers. Comic strip writers are masters of this intellectual engagement and novelty.  I have been working on a project to integrate marketing sponsorships with comic strip authorship, to take advantage of the originality inherent in this medium. I think this will work, because the supply of comic artists and writers is strictly limited. Unlike AdWords, not everybody can publish a comic strip. This should help keep the sponsored comic content concept fresh for a while, even on the Internet.

Now I have a question. This article mentions three things: affinity, novelty, and humor. Can you suggest ways to combine these three elements into a point presentation which will sell an individual objective on the crowd-sourced Internet?
