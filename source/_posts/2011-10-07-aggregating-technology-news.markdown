When I was studying Mathematics, in the early 70s, an instructor commented that far more Mathematics was published every year than any one person could read. While too much of a good thing is a waste, probably back then only a small portion of the published material was truly important to the progress of Mathematics.

Today technologists are faced with the same conundrum. During the past month, I have wasted a couple of hours each day reading technology news. (This partly explains my lack of blog posts in the interval.)  I am using aggregation sites to match articles to my interests, but I still see many articles which are not even worth a skim. What I really want is a program like Google Reader, but which analyzes how much time I spend on an article compared to the article’s length. Then the program should search for additional articles which I will actually read, as opposed to skimming or skipping. But here lies a fallacy. I wish to be informed about new technologies which are important (to me). Obviously, articles about what I have already read cannot deliver novel information about technology. So, I will continue to skim and skip through technology aggregations, looking for new and important information.

Meanwhile, topics of interest to AAltSys Technologies come up every day. Here is a sample of today’s interesting news.

* [Jack Dorsey wants to extend the mobile phone for free](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/jack_dorsey_talks_square_at_leweb.php)
* [Google sees Google as in the social networking business](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/join-this-group-google-groups-joins.html)
* [Google makes the web experience better and faster](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/faster-apps-for-faster-web-introducing.html)
* [Magazine publishers band together for survival](http://mediamemo.allthingsd.com/20091208/nows-the-time-finally-publishers-announce-their-hulu-for-magazines-next-up-building-it/)

Enjoy your reading.
